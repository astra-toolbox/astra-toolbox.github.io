2025-08-04: Version 2.4
-----------------------

* Add initial experimental support for building with AMD HIP instead of CUDA.
* Improve performance of automatic splitting for FDK/FP3D/BP3D when data doesn't fit in GPU memory
* Add conda packages for CUDA 12.9
* Fix non-deterministic results when FBP_CUDA was used with fanflat_vec geometries (e.g. when
  post-alignment was applied).
* Fix crash when trying to delete linked 3D data in MATLAB.
* Fix Python samples.

2025-04-16: Version 2.3.1
-------------------------
* Fix GPULink missing in astra.data3d module
* Fix crash in MATLAB when calling astra_mex_direct

2025-02-22: Version 2.3
-----------------------
* Add support for zero-copy linking of GPU/CPU arrays from Python libraries supporting the DLPack
  standard, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, CuPy and JAX. See ``astra.data3d.link`` documentation
  in :doc:`docs/data3d` for more information. Note that linking of 2D data is still only
  implemented for NumPy arrays.
* Add support for using different filter types in :doc:`docs/algs/FDK_CUDA`. The filter
  configuration for FDK_CUDA now matches that for FBP/FBP_CUDA.
* Add conda packages for Python 3.13, CUDA 12.6, 12.8, and NumPy 2.
* Add automatic asynchronous execution to ``astra.experimental`` functions in Python.
* Add automatic splitting of FDK execution along angular dimension, allowing for larger maximum
  number of projections.
* Add error reporting in ``astra.algorithm.run`` function.
* Add an extensive Python unit test suite.
* Fix incorrect results with GPUs with more than 48GB of memory.
* Fix multiple minor bugs.
* Require C++17, raising minimum system requirements to CUDA 11.

  the installation size.

* Add experimental Python interfaces to FP3D, BP3D, FDK to make ASTRA calls by 3rd party toolboxes
  more efficient and flexible.

2020-01-17: Version 1.9.9dev: Changes in output scaling of projectors
---------------------------------------------------------------------
We have changed the way gray values in forward projections, backprojections and reconstructions
scale with the size of detector pixels.  This does not impact geometries where the detector pixels
have size 1 in 2D, or 1x1 in 3D.

In the upcoming ASTRA 2.0, and starting from version 1.9.9.dev, for all geometries and projectors,
the value of a pixel in a forward projection is approximately the value of the line integral of
the corresponding ray through the volume.

Of course the interpolation/projection method used will still determine the exact set of pixels
contributing to a ray and the exact value as before.

All backprojectors and reconstruction algorithms have been adapted to match the forward projection.

Before this change, a decision made in the early pre-1.0 days of ASTRA to make detector values
scale linearly with the area of detector pixels led to some in hindsight mathematically
unresolvable inconsistencies in behaviour between parallel and fan/cone geometries, and behaviour
with oblique projections. The new definition resolves this inherent inconsistency.

Specific changes:

* all parallel beam 2D projectors (CPU and CUDA) have been changed as above
* the 2D fan beam CPU projectors have been changed as above
* the 2D fan beam CUDA projector did not require changing
* the 3D CUDA backprojectors have been changed as above. The forward projectors did not require changing
* the 2D fan beam and 3D cone beam CUDA backprojectors now have an improved approximate match with the respective forward projectors

2019-07-09: Version 1.9.0.dev
-----------------------------
* Add 2D parallel_vec geometry
* The ExtraDetectorOffset option has been removed. Please use
  parallel_vec to achieve this effect now
* Fix inconsistent rotation direction in CPU fan beam code

* Fix some restrictions that were limiting 3D data sizes
* Add more filter configuration options for CPU FBP (matching GPU FBP)
* Add astra_test / astra.test() functions to test basic CPU/GPU functionality
* Enable use of the cone_vec geometry for FDK_CUDA. NB: This lets you do
  things that are not mathematically sensible, and should only be used for
  geometries that are effectively circular cone beam geometries.
* Compatibility fixes for new Windows, Linux, CUDA versions
* Windows packages now require CUDA 9.0 or higher
