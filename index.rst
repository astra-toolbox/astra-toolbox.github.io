The ASTRA Toolbox
=================

The ASTRA Toolbox is a MATLAB and Python toolbox of high-performance GPU primitives for 2D and 3D tomography.

We support 2D parallel and fan beam geometries, and 3D parallel and cone beam. All of them have highly flexible source/detector positioning.

A large number of 2D and 3D algorithms are available, including FBP, SIRT, SART, CGLS.

The basic forward and backward projection operations are GPU-accelerated, and directly callable from MATLAB and Python to enable building new algorithms.

The source code of the ASTRA Toolbox is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/astra-toolbox/astra-toolbox>`_.

Latest News
-----------

* In the latest development version of ASTRA (1.9.9.dev), we have made some consistency improvements to the grey value output ranges of the FP and BP operations. See the `News section <news.html>`_ for more information.

* For those visiting `ICTMS 2019 <http://ictms2019.org/>`_ in Australia, we will host `an ASTRA workshop <ictms.html>`_ there on 22 July 2019.

* Windows Matlab/Python packages of the current 1.9.0.dev version of ASTRA
  git master are now available for download below. These require CUDA 9.0+.

* We now have development Python packages available from ASTRA git master on conda. Quick installation instructions: ``conda install -c astra-toolbox/label/dev astra-toolbox`` .

* 7 dec 2016: ASTRA v1.8 released
